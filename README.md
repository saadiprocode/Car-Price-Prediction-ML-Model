# Car-Price-Prediction-ML-Model

A machine learning web application that predicts the selling price of a used car based on various input parameters such as brand, year, mileage, and engine power. The model is trained on real-world car data and provides quick and reliable predictions through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how regression models can be applied to estimate car prices.
Users can input car details and instantly get a predicted price based on the trained model.
